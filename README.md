# Word2Vec Model Implementation

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that explores the implementation and application of the Word2Vec model to generate word embeddings that capture semantic meanings of words. This project uses the gensim library to demonstrate training and application of Word2Vec in real-world NLP tasks.

## Overview
Word2Vec is a groundbreaking approach in NLP, known for its ability to capture contextual nuances of words in a high-dimensional space. This notebook guides users through the process of training a Word2Vec model from scratch, tuning its parameters, and applying the generated embeddings to solve specific NLP problems.

## Key Features
- Comprehensive guide to setting up and training Word2Vec models
- Detailed exploration of the model's hyperparameters and their impact on performance
- Application of Word2Vec embeddings in tasks such as similarity detection, clustering, and classification
- Visualization of word embeddings to understand their semantic relationships

## Libraries Used
- `gensim` for implementing the Word2Vec model
- `nltk` for text preprocessing
- `pandas` for data handling
- `matplotlib` and `plotly` for visualizing embeddings

## Usage
This notebook is intended for students, researchers, and developers with an interest in machine learning and NLP. It serves as both an educational resource and a practical guide for integrating Word2Vec into various NLP pipelines.

You have to install these files to run the notebook:
1. cc.en.300.bin.gz
2. glove.6B.100d.txt
3. cc.en.300.bin
   
## Contributions
Contributions are encouraged to enhance the functionality of the models, such as by improving preprocessing techniques, experimenting with different architecture settings, or extending the notebook to cover more advanced applications of embeddings.
